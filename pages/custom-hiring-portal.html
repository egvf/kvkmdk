                    Farm Mechanization in agriculture will help in increasing productivity and reduce the cost of
                    cultivation and also enable the farmer to complete farming operations in time. Farm mechanization in
                    the State is accentuated by the shortage of agricultural labor due to the increased migration of
                    rural workers to urban areas. Mechanization possibility is strongly influenced by the farm size,
                    cost of farm labour, labour shortage at peak times of demand is a serious problem faced by farmers,
                    and machines and energy a serious problem faced by farmers. However, in the Medak district, the
                    majority of the farmers come under small and marginal categories and their land holdings are less
                    than two hectares, the farming system continues to utilize manual power and animal power. The
                    age-old concept of sharing farm implements and tools among farmers in a village has been severely
                    eroded. Purchase and use of hi-tech farm machinery are not viable and affordable to the small and
                    marginal farmers, there is a necessity to provide a way for them to use farm machinery. In order to
                    bring more land under cultivation and to improve productivity per unit area it is necessary to
                    introduce other sources of power like tractors, and power tillers under the custom hiring center
