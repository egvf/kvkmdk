                    Sri N. Ashok progressive farmer of N.jalalpur Village Kulcharam Mandal Medak district. Earlier
                    growing paddy crops by manual transplantation used to require more labor, seed, and time. He came to
                    know about the implement (Drum seeder) for direct seeding of paddy and contacted KVK, Medak from
                    where he got details of its application on the field. Now he is growing paddy successfully using an
                    8-row manual-operated drum seeder under the supervision of KVK Scientists.

                    The paddy seed is soaked in water for 24 hours after that seed treatment is performed and the
                    sprouted seeds are filled in boxes of the seeder before soaking the seed paddling of the field is
                    completed. The paddy seed is sown at a row distance of 20 cm. It saved the seed, labor cost of
                    transplanting weeding cost and time requirement is less. The crop matured 10 days in advance and
                    about a 10 percent yield increase is observed The increase in yield was observed to be 24 to 27
                    q/ac. thus the total income from growing paddy using this technology has increased to the tune of
                    8000/- per acre.

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                With this KVK has introduced this technology in Havelighanpur, Chilipched, Shivampet, Narsapur,
                Kowdipally, Kulcharam and other Mandals of Medak district, a total of 150 farmers were adopted this
                technology of direct seeding of rice with drum seeder in the district in an area of 60 ha. This
                technology has reduced the cost of cultivation by 7000 to 10000 Rs. per ac in the drum seeder method
                compared to the conventional method of rice cultivation and hence direct seeding method using drum
                seeder is profitable for farmers even if the farmers are getting the same normal/regular yields.

                <h2>Impact</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                There is a growing acceptance of the drum seeder version due to factors like low seed rate low
                irrigation water requirement, skipping of nursery and transplanting operations, and subsequently a
                reduction in drudgery early crop maturity by 7-10 days and higher productivity in the drum seeder
                method. This is evident from the rise in area under the drum seeder method in Medak district from 0.1 ha
                in 2020 to 60 ha in 2021
