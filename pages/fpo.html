                    Both FPOs were planning to start an Agri-Input center with available capital. Once they receive an
                    equity grant from NCDC, these FPO will start the Business of Dall Mill (Nizampet FPO) and Oil mill
                    (Medak FPO) with available capital as share capital, income from input business, and equity grant
                    amount. Most of the members of FPOs are Marginal and small farmers, the business like Agri input
                    center help members to get quality inputs like Seeds, Fertilizers, and Pesticides also FPO get

                    business transactions of FPO and obtain additional sources of income for FPO.
