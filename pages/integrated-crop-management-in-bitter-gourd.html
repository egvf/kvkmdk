                    The area under cucurbitaceous crops is occupied the second position after tomato in Medak district.
                    Among the cucurbits, the cultivation area of bitter gourd is predominant. Most of the farmers are
                    growing on pandal systems and low-cost temporary pandal systems and also some of the farmers are
                    allowed to creep on the ground. But, farmers are unaware of the ICM practices like the application
                    of a recommended dose of fertilizers along with organic manures, bio-fertilizers, & micro nutrients
                    and integrated pest and disease management. The major problems in bitter gourd cultivation are high
                    fruit fly infestation, leaf minor, downy mildew, yellowing of fruits due to micronutrient
                    deficiencies, and more number of male flowers than female flowers. So, the yield was recorded as
                    very low. To the management of these problems, farmers are using indiscriminate usage of
                    fertilizers, fungicides, and insecticides, which are involved in high cost of cultivation and low
                    net income.

                        After analysis of those problems in bitter gourd cultivation, I have conducted training programs
                        and group discussions to create awareness about ICM practices. After that, I have given a method
                        demonstration on the erection of pheromone traps, sticky traps, and biofertilizers application.
                        Initially, the demonstration is conducted at 2 to 3 farmers in each Mandal. After that, I
                        conducted field days at the demonstration field to extend the technology among the farmers and
                        also facilitated exposure visits to the farmers. In this way, I have planned to promote the
                        technology. Meanwhile, I have distributed critical inputs like pheromone traps, sticky traps,
                        bio-fertilizers, and biopesticides which are not available in the local market, and visited
                        farmer's fields at regular intervals to implement the technology in the right manner and also to
                        give suggestions or recommendations for existing problems.

                        The farmers who followed this technology; they produced 1 to 1.5 tons of extra yields than the
                        check. Moreover, the farmers earned more net income, and the cost of cultivation was reduced by
                        controlling pests and diseases at the initial level. The farmers also used bio fertilizers and
                        bio fungicides along with organic & inorganic fertilizers, fungicides, and insecticides. Erected
                        pheromone traps 10/acre to monitor the fruit fly infestation and their management. Blue and
                        yellow sticky traps are kept to control the sucking pests. Neem oil is used as a prophylactic
                        spray once every 10 to 15 days at intervals to control the pests. Farmers gained knowledge about
                        the `importance and role of bio-fertilizers, bio pesticides, and pheromone traps. All these
                        integrated crop management practices enhanced crop yield and net income and also reduced the
                        cost of cultivation.

                        I have conducted field-level demonstrations, training, method demonstrations, and group
                        discussion in 3 to 4 villages in every Mandal to spread this technology. So, this technology was
                        spread among the farmers and 265 farmers were followed on 163 acres. Through this technology,
                        indiscriminate usage of fertilizers and pesticides is avoided by farmers and also minimized 30
                        percent of inorganic fertilizers usage which is compensated by organic manures and
                        biofertilizers. The pest and disease infestation was minimized by using bio fungicides,
                        biopesticides, pheromone traps, and sticky traps, and also these ICM practices reduced the cost
                        of cultivation by about Rs.11,850 per hectare and increased their net income is about Rs.82,850
                        per hectare.

                        In bitter gourd cultivation, major problems are varietal selection, downy mildew disease,
                        sucking pests, and fruit fly infestations. These problems are plays a major role in the
                        increasing cost of cultivation, reducing the crop yield and net Income. These are effectively
                        managed by integrated crop management practices in bitter gourd. At present, the cultivation
                        area is increased from 150 acres in 2016-17 to 850 acres in 2020-21. The existing farmers also
                        increased their cultivating area of bitter gourd under the pandal system as farmers are getting
                        a good net income from this crop compared to other vegetable crops. This crop is also cultivated
                        by using a low-cost temporary pandal system for those who were not having a permanent pandal
                        system. In Medak district, the cucurbateous crops occupied second position in the area after
                        tomato.
