                    portal since KVKâ€™s inception by ICAR. Every month we are sending messages to at least one lack
                    farmer in the Medak district through this portal. In 2021 we reached about 1.5 lakh farmers through

                    farmers of Medak district regarding agriculture, horticulture, farm mechanization, weather report,
                    and other available new technologies in the market suitable for KVK operational area farmers. Along
