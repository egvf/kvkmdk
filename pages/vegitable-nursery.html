                        The nursery means a place where young plants or seedlings are grown for sale or for planting
                        elsewhere.

                        Some of the vegetable crops like tomato, brinjal, chili, cabbage, cauliflower, gourds, and
                        flower crops like marigold seeds are raised in the nursery under 50% shade net to achieve
                        maximum germination count and healthy plant establishment and then transplanted to the main
                        field.

                    <li>For vegetable seedlings production, the shade net structure was established in 0.25 acres at

                        Seedlings should be irrigated regularly for better growth and development of the seedlings. Rose
                        can or flush boom can be used to irrigate the seedlings. Excess irrigation is also dangerous for
                        the growing seedlings as there might be chances of developing collar rot, root rot, and foliar
                        diseases.

                        Nutrient management is important to raise healthy seedlings apart from the nutrients present in
                        the coco peat or growing media. The nutrition is supplied through foliar application of
                        panchaghavya@ 10 ml per lit and Fish amino acid @ 10 ml per lit alternate with 3 to 4 days
                        intervals and also drench with jeevamrutham & waste decomposer (1:4 ratio) once in a week.
